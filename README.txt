INTRODUCTION:
The goal of this hyperparameter project is to create a database consisting of hyperparameters that were extracted by running various machine learning models (classification/regression) on multiple datasets. Using the database of hyperparameters that is generated we will suggest hyperparameters for the dataset that the user would like to run ML models on; this aspect of the project is not currently within our scope therefore we will limit ourselves to building a database of hyperparameters for one dataset.

This project folder contains the following files:
Create_CSVs.ipynb - Python code to scrape the data generated by H20 into JSON files
Hyperparameter_Database.sql - Complete dump of the hyperparameter database with sample data
Project Report.pdf - Comprehensive report of the hyperparameter database project
LICENSE.txt - licensing information for the project docs
Leaderboard.csv - contains the model data with performance metrics
Hyperparameter.csv - contains the list of hyperparameters and their values
tags.csv - contains the tags generated from the description of the dataset on Kaggle along with the word frequency
Runs.csv - contains run information such as how long the each run took and how much memory, etc..
Hyperparameters.txt - contains the list of hyperparameters provided by the Data Science team to be used when scraping them from JSON files.
bottle.csv - primary dataset of the hyperparameter project
Extracted Files - Folder containing the JSON files generated after each run
